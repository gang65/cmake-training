1. To compile source code and create `table` executable, type command:
```
cd build
g++ ../table.cpp ../multiple/multiple.cpp -I../multiple -o table
```
2. To run application type command:

```
./table
```

# Tasks

1. Compiling application independently:

* Compile object files from source code:
```
  $ cd build
  $ g++ -c ../table.cpp ../multiple/multiple.cpp -I../multiple
```
after running such command, two object files will be created:
```
  multiple.o
  table.o
```
* Run `file` command on object file.

For macOS the output of the `file` command will be:
```
$ file multiple.o
multiple.cpp.o: Mach-O 64-bit object x86_64
```

2. Generate source code with [preprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprocessor):
```
  $ g++ -E ../table.cpp -I../multiple > table.i
```
* Compare original source code with source code generated by preprocessor.

3. Add multiple `#include "multiple.hpp"` in `table.cpp` file, and run preprocessor.

* Compare result with previous run. Explain what was caused such behaviour.
